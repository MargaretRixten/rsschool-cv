### Briefly About Myself:

I have always loved to sit at the computer and deal with some problem. 
I started learning photoshop, but I realized that
I'm not creative enough to create my own designs.
So I started learning by learning html and css.
I have made several single page websites. Then I started learning js. 
I am currently working as a junior developer. 
I like to learn new things, 
I work well in a team and I can find a common language with people, 
I can set priorities, meet deadlines, 
I can defend my point of view and calmly convey it to people

### Code example:
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. 
The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. 
The string can contain any char.
```
function XO(str) {
    let arr = [];
    let countX = 0
    let countO = 0;
    arr = str.toLowerCase().split('');
    for(let i = 0; i <= str.length - 1; i++) {
        if(arr[i] === 'x') {
            countX++;
        } else if (arr[i] === 'o') {
            countO++;
        }
    }
    return countX === countO;
}
```
